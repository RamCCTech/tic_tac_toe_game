# Introduction to Create React App

This project was initiated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful tool for quickly setting up and managing React applications.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you have access to the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Launches the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to preview the application.

The page will automatically reload upon making changes.\
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include unique hashes.\
Your application is now ready for deployment!

Explore the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for information on deploying your app.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

If customization of build tools and configurations is needed, use `eject`. This command removes the single build dependency from your project, copying all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) for full control. Note that all commands except `eject` will still work, but they will now point to the copied scripts.

Feel free to skip `eject` if the provided feature set suits your needs. It's suitable for small to mid-sized deployments, and extensive customization is not obligatory.
